# RShiny App for "Toward an improved understanding of causation in the ecological sciences"

The app.R file can be downloaded to view/run in RStudio. The module is interactive and data/models are generated/run at the click of 
buttons thorughout. You may need to click all previous buttons for the next to work properly as the module builds on itself to show that AIC may not select the model
that describes the correct process.
